**The** **Passion** **Discovery** **Journal**

**Project** **Overview**

This is a personal project built in Python to solve a problem that many
people my age face: **ﬁguring** **out** **what** **we** **are**
**actually** **passionate** **about.**

Instead of just guessing, this program helps you track your daily
activities and scores them based on real psychological metrics like
"Flow State," energy levels, and curiosity. Over time, it turns feelings
into data to help identify what truly matters to you.

**Why** **I** **Built** **This** **(My** **Story)**

I am a kid who has struggled with ﬁnding a passion for a long time. I
have spent years bouncing between different career paths and hobbies,
desperately trying to ﬁnd "the one."

To give you an idea of how confusing it has been:

> **·** **Academics:** In 11th grade, I started studying **Commerce**...
> and switched to **PCMB** (Science) after just one week.
>
> **·** **Hobbies:** I have tried everything from **classical**
> **music,** **karate,** **and** **guitar** to **chess**.
>
> **·** **Careers:** I've explored **game** **development** and even
> **biotech-related** **ﬁelds**.

I realized I wasn't lacking interests—I was drowning in them. I needed a
way to objectively look at what I was doing and ﬁgure out which one
actually made me happy, rather than just guessing. That is why I built
this tool.

**Features**

> **·** **Activity** **Logging:** Input what you did and rate it on 4
> key metrics (1-10).
>
> **·** **Visual** **Graph:** See a text-based bar chart of your scores
> directly in the terminal.
>
> **·** **Analysis:**Automatically calculates and displays your
> highest-rated activity.
>
> **·** **Battle** **Mode:** Pits your top two activities against each
> other in a "head-to-head" decision game to help you prioritize your
> life goals.
>
> **·** **Daily** **Inspiration:** Gives you a random motivational quote
> to keep you going.

**How** **to** **Run** **It**

> 1\. Make sure you have Python installed.
>
> 2\. Download the Passion Discovery Journal.pyﬁle.
>
> 3\. Run the command (don't forget the quotes!):
>
> python "Passion Discovery Journal.py"
>
> 4\. Follow the on-screen menu to start logging!

**Requirements**
